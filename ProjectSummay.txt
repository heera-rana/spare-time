# DTSS Assignment 1 'Spare Time'

## Development Team:
Ryan Sutcliffe
Maria Diome Pena
Heera Rana
Rachael Lawlor


## Application Summary:
Spare Time is a web application that allows users to view events that are happing in the local area. The idea is for local people to create their own events and advertise them to local people. 
The name Spare Time derives from people having busy lives, especially in the city centre of Leeds, therefore when they have spare time, they can view the things that are happening locally, and spend their time supporting the local community.

As a user that is not logged in to the application, they can read and filter the events

As a user that has registered to use the application, they will be able to create, read, update and delete events.

## Work Approach:

### Agile Methodology - Kanban
Within our organisation they have adopted an agile way of working, with each team opting for their own adaptaion on an agile methodology.
For the Spare Time applcation we choose to use the Kanban methodology, as we felt using scrum would limit the amount of work we could achieve in a sprint, and the lack of experience in the team of manging a scrum approach. 
Kanban allowed us to move through tickets quickly, and work different areas of the applcation.

We came up with a backlog with MoSCoW notation (Must have, should have, could have, would have) informing priorities. Each team member can claim any ticket, and is then responsible for completing the work associated.

### Ceremonies of work
We had one weekly meeting normally on a Thursday, for a couple of hours. This covered a retrospecive meeting, and a ticket review.
We had daily communcations through Slack, which any problems would be solved, or any discussed about the prority of tickets. 

### Work strategy

### Communication
